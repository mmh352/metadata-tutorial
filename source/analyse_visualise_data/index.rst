Analysis & Visualisation
========================

The previous blocks have covered loading and then filtering/transforming the data in preparation for analysis and visualisation. While the tutorial up to this point has been relatively linear, this is not the case for the analysis and visualisation sections. You are free to do them in any order you wish, although the recommendation in general is to analyse first and then visualise what the analysis shows to be interesting.
